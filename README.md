# Stock-Alarm
Python project for monitoring stock prices and alerting with email

Simple web crawler designed to use with google searches of stocks and retrieving information (Share name and price)
sends alert to user's email with gmail account.
Don't bother to try to steal my e-mail the account has 2 step verification, so the application password is useless.
